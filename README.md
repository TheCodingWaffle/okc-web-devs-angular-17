# OKCWebDevs Angular 17

This project highlights some of the new features with Angular v17:

- [Signals](https://angular.dev/guide/signals)
- [Built-in control flow](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/control-flow)
- [Stand-alone Components](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components)

A great reference to so visit the shiny new [Angular Documentation site](https://angular.dev/). It's got easy to understand tutorials and an online playground to "try before you buy".
